### Project Description
This project is basically a web-app that converts any given set of emojis to a random recipe (that kinda makes sense!). It also has the feature of malayalam recipes(in the absurd mode!). We featured a few common emotions for which 
random recipes are generated.

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
We often associate food with emotions.. but we think all emojions(and emojis) deserve a fair chance and so we built this app.
### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
Feeling sad? Feeling happy? Feeling empty? Feeling.. üí£?? We got you. Randomest most absurd recipes that are meant to mean.. NOTHING!
